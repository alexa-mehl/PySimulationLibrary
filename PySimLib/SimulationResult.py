This class holds the values that a simulation generates.
The values in the object are stored in a dictionary that maps each variable to a vector of values of this variable.
The following should illustrate that:
values = 
{
	"x" : [t1(x), t2(x)....],
	"y" : [t1(y), t2(y)....],
	"time" : [t1(time), t2(time)...],
	...
}

Note: Also the simulation time should be present with the name "time" (CASE SENSITIVE).
